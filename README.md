# Pathfinding-Visualisation-ex

This is a basic Pathfinding tool reproduced from a third party source as proof of functionality. The aim was to properly construct a pathfinding tool
to further my own knowledge on programming for correct practice and etiquette with coding techniques as well as to inspire and galvanise myself to continue learning 
to programme. This programme was constructed on the latest release of Atom Text Editor and appropriate packages.

The controls are simple; one left click for the point of origin, a second will set the termination point and pressing the spacebar will execute the programme.
